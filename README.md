# Azure Summer Internship Documentation

Welcome to the documentation repository for my Azure summer internship! This repository contains detailed notes, steps, and insights from the internship where we explored a comprehensive range of topics related to Azure.

Over the course of nearly one month, I had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of Azure, including networking, virtual machines, storage, and more. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to the topics covered and the steps followed during the internship.

The notes for each day of the internship are organized in separate files, providing a detailed account of the topics discussed and the steps taken.

This repository also includes details about the two projects completed during the internship.

Contributions are welcome! If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvements, please create a pull request or open an issue.
